# Hermit Retro Products -- Hermit Controller Casing Files

This folder contains the files for the Hermit Retro Controller casing.

The source code for the casing is in `hermitretro-controller-case.scad`
and should be opened in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org). The file will
take quite a while to compile. You can ignore the warning about a missing
include file.

Precompiled STL files are also available for the upper and lower halves.
I tend to print these lying flat on the printer bed and use filament
printing. Resin prints are smoother, but more brittle and prone to
scratching.

To join the upper and lower halves, I tend to melt brass inserts into
the posts on the upper half, then screw M3x12 screws into them through the
lower half. The brass inserts are available here: [RS Online Threaded Brass
Inserts](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/threaded-inserts/0278534).
